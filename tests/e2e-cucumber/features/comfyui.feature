Feature: ComfyUI runtime selection is actionable

  # `rocm comfyui install` picks the ROCm runtime to install into. When more than
  # one managed runtime is ready and none is activated as the default, the CLI
  # refuses to guess — the same all-or-nothing policy `serve` uses. That refusal
  # is surfaced in `rocm comfyui install`'s command output, where `--runtime-id`
  # and `rocm runtimes activate` apply and the `/runtimes` pointer is for the same
  # text read from a terminal. This scenario asserts that CLI surface only: the
  # refusal does not reach the TUI chat, which is machine-checked by
  # `approved_command_failure_stays_a_collapsed_envelope`
  # (`crates/rocm-dash-tui/src/app/mod.rs`) and explained at the seam that decides
  # it (`execute_approved` in `apps/rocm/src/dash_seam.rs`).
  #
  # No GPU is needed: runtime readiness is filesystem + manifest state, so the
  # scenario plants two ready wheel runtimes and asserts the refusal names every
  # remediation and lists both keys. Linux-only because the planted rocm_sdk stub
  # uses `.so` library names; the selection logic it exercises is platform-agnostic.

  Scenario: comfyui-01 - ComfyUI install refuses ambiguously and names every remediation
    Given two ready ROCm runtimes and no active default
    When the user installs ComfyUI without choosing a runtime
    Then ComfyUI install is refused as ambiguous
    And the refusal offers the /runtimes picker
    And the refusal names the --runtime-id flag
    And the refusal names rocm runtimes activate
    And the refusal lists both runtime keys
