## Problem

Parent: fix-speed-up-e2e umbrella (wlticket #47). Parent WIP: /Users/fres/Developer/rocm-cli-progress/fix-speed-up-e2e.md (Task #9). Gets its own WIP referencing the parent when work starts.

GOAL: Add a narrow 'serve' paths-filter so Rust-but-not-serve PRs (dash-only changes, unrelated crates) skip the heavy GPU serve matrix entirely.

LIVE-MAIN STATE (verified 2026-07-30, ci.yml 'changes' job, dorny/paths-filter@v4): the 'heavy' filter is COARSE — it trips on '**/*.rs', '**/Cargo.toml', 'Cargo.lock', 'rust-toolchain*', 'scripts/**', 'engines/**', '**/*.py', '**/*.sh', '**/*.ps1', '**/*.feature', 'tests/e2e-cucumber/expectations.toml', 'install*', 'docs/keys/**', '.github/workflows/**'. So ANY .rs change fires the whole GPU matrix, even when serve code is untouched.

DESIGN: add a dedicated 'serve' filter covering engines/**, the apps/rocm serve code path, crates/rocm-core, '**/*.feature', the e2e-cucumber crate, PLUS broad-dep safety nets (Cargo.lock, workflow files) — and gate the GPU serve jobs on it. ERR TOWARD INCLUSION: a false skip of a serve-affecting PR is worse than an extra run; when unsure, run.

PAIRS WITH Task #8 (#99): both are ci.yml trigger/paths edits — likely one branch/PR/WIP. SUPERSEDES the #9 portion of old bundled ticket #44.

## Solution

_TBD — design the approach._

## Next Steps

1. Design the solution, then implement.
