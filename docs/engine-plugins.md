# Engine Plugins

rocm-cli discovers serving engine adapters as executable files.

Search order:

1. `<data_dir>/engines/plugins`
2. `<data_dir>/engines`
3. Packaged sibling binaries installed beside `rocm`

The first directory is the preferred location for external adapters. Use a
binary name in the form `rocm-engine-<engine>` on Linux/WSL and
`rocm-engine-<engine>.exe` on Windows.

Packaged first-party adapters are `lemonade` and `vllm`. Linux/WSL-only ROCm GPU
adapters (such as `vllm`) fail explicitly on native Windows instead of selecting
a CPU fallback.

The engine-selecting commands (`rocm serve --engine`, `rocm engines
install`/`shell`, `rocm config set-engine`/`set-default-engine`) currently accept
only the built-in `lemonade` and `vllm` engines. Discovery still lists external
plugins under the search directories above, but selecting one by name from the
CLI is not supported while the engine set is limited to the two built-ins.

The `lemonade` adapter uses Lemonade embeddable and prefers Lemonade's
`llamacpp:rocm` backend, falling back to `llamacpp:vulkan` when ROCm is
unsupported. rocm-cli does not use a CPU fallback for this path.

`rocm engines list` shows the exact plugin directories for the current host.
The same output is available in the TUI with `/engine`.

Installer policy:

- `install.sh` and `install.ps1` update only the rocm-cli binary install
  directory and its `.rocm-cli-manifest`.
- External plugins under the rocm-cli data directory are not touched by
  install or upgrade.
- `rocm uninstall` removes the data directory by default. Use
  `rocm uninstall --keep-data` when external plugins, managed runtimes,
  service records, or model cache entries should be preserved.

No fallback engine is selected automatically. If an engine adapter is missing
or cannot satisfy the requested device policy, the command must fail until the
requested engine is installed or the user explicitly selects a different one.
